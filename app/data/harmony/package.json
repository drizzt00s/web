  "readme": "# Harmony\n\nBecause parsing forms shouldn't be hard.\n\n## Parsing forms, especially uploads, is confusing.\n\nNode.js, and the Connect middleware framework is uncharted territory for most developers. This module makes form parsing easy (by exposing lower-level API's, not manipulating them), and helps keep your form parsing code DRY.\n\nThis module borrows a lot of [TJ Holowaychuk](http://tjholowaychuk.com/)'s [connect-form](http://github.com/visionmedia/connect-form/), but aims to provide a more flexible API, allowing you to easily parse multi-file uploads, and other advanced submissions.\n\n## License\n\nBasically, this is open source software, and you use it at your own risk. Don't run back cryin', if it destroys your computer, burns down your house, or causes relationship problems with your significant other. If you need more detail, read the included LICENSE document.",
